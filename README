# PyFeed

PyFeed is a terminal-based RSS/Atom feed reader written in Python. It uses `curses` for the interface, allowing you to browse and read your news feeds directly from the command line.

The application idea is taken from [sfeed](https://codemadness.org/git/sfeed/file/README.html) which is written in C.

## Features

-   **Two-Pane Interface:** Browse feed sources primarily on the left and their articles on the right.
-   **Vim-like Navigation:** Use `j`, `k`, `h`, `l` for efficient navigation.
-   **Search:** Integrated search functionality to find specific articles or feeds.
-   **Browser Integration:** Open articles in your default web browser.
-   **Read State Tracking:** Mark articles or entire feeds as read.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd pyfeed
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

PyFeed requires a configuration file and a data directory in your home folder.

1.  **Create the configuration directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.pyfeed/feeds
    ```

2.  **Copy the example configuration:**
    ```bash
    cp pyfeedrc.example ~/.pyfeed/pyfeedrc
    ```

3.  **Edit the configuration:**
    Open `~/.pyfeed/pyfeedrc` in your text editor and add your RSS/Atom feeds in the `FEEDS` dictionary.

    ```python
    FEEDS = {
        'News Site': 'https://example.com/rss',
        'Blog': 'https://blog.example.com/feed.xml'
    }
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Update Feeds
Before reading, you need to fetch the latest articles from your configured feeds.

```bash
python pyfeed_update.py
```
